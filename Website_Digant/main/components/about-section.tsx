                Hi everyone! I'm Digant Suwal, a BSc (Hons) Computing student at The British College. I have a keen
                interest in emerging technologies, and I absolutely love development and creating new things. I'm still
                learning, growing, and exploring something new every day.
              </p>

              <p>
                Beyond the tech world, I'm deeply fond of art, painting, music, and operas. I also enjoy diving into my
                culture and history‚Äîuncovering the stories and meanings behind my different traditions and legends
                fascinates me.
              </p>

              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy drawing, playing football with my dear friends and neighbors, and immersing
                myself in video games, films, and anime. I love going on bike rides, and I really like dairy‚Äîespecially
                curd. YUMMY! üòã
              </p>

              <p>
                Health is very important to me, so I train daily by hitting the gym early in the mornings. It keeps me
                grounded, energized, and motivated.
              </p>

              <p>
                My dream is to do something impactful in tech‚Äîsomething that can genuinely help the world, especially in
                the fields of space exploration and medicine. If I hadn't chosen computer science, I truly might have
                pursued medicine instead, to serve people directly by helping them heal and live healthy lives. But
                since I haven't chosen medicine in this life, I hope to contribute to the medical field through
                AI‚Äîcreating something that could one day support and uplift humanity.
              </p>

              <p>
                Another big dream of mine is to travel the world soaking in the beauty of different cultures, spending
                time on beaches, and just chilling out while appreciating life. üåè üèñÔ∏è
              </p>

              <p>
                A quote I live by is: "You don't have much time. Do whatever you can right now, because time really
                passes that fast."
              </p>

              <p>And honestly? That keeps me going every single day. üíØ</p>
